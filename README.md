Two different neuron models are present:
  1. A neuron model that exactly matches the digital LIF neuron in the neuromorphic hardware described in this paper." With constants that replicate our Cadence hardware simulations.
  2. A more general LIF neuron model that could represent other implementations. This was adopted to show the generalizability of the hardware-aware training approach. A variation of LIF implementations exist and our results showed that for dif
