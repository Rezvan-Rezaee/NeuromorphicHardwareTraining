10-TIMESTEP SPIKING WINDOW VS STEADY-STATE SOFTLIF (RATE) SURROGATE

1) DISCRETE-TIME WINDOW DEFINITION
- Discrete simulation timestep: Δt (seconds per step)
- Number of timesteps: T
- Total simulated time:
  T_total = T · Δt

Example:
  Δt = 1 ms, T = 10  →  T_total = 10 ms

2) EXPONENTIAL SETTLING OF THE LIF MEMBRANE STATE
For a passive membrane (RC / LIF subthreshold dynamics) under constant drive, the membrane potential approaches its steady value exponentially:
  u(t) = u_rest + R I0 (1 − exp(−t/τ_m))

Equivalently, the fraction remaining to steady state after time t is:
  ε(t) = exp(−t/τ_m)

Example time-scale matching:
Choose τ_m such that T_total spans several τ_m.
If τ_m = 2 ms and T_total = 10 ms, then:
  t/τ_m = 10/2 = 5
  ε = exp(−5) ≈ 0.0067
So the membrane is within ~0.67% of steady state (≈99.3% settled) by the end of the 10-step window.

3) ALIGNMENT OF SPIKING LIF WITH A STEADY-STATE RATE SURROGATE
Under constant suprathreshold drive, LIF neurons exhibit tonic spiking with a well-defined firing-rate vs input relationship (f–I curve). A steady-state rate surrogate (e.g., SoftLIF/LIFRate variants) is intended to approximate this steady mapping rather than transient responses. Therefore, selecting τ_m relative to T_total so that the membrane reaches its steady regime supports the use of a short spiking window as an approximation to the rate model.

4) SPIKE-COUNT READOUT ACCURACY AND POPULATION AVERAGING
If spikes are read out via spike counts in the window and a Poisson baseline is assumed for spike-count variability, then for spike count N in the window:
  E[N] = λ
  Var(N) = λ

If a population code averages across M approximately independent neurons:
  N_bar = (1/M) Σ_i N_i

Then the variance of the average scales as:
  Var(N_bar) = (1/M^2) Σ_i Var(N_i)  ≈  (1/M^2) · M · λ  =  λ / M
(assuming similar λ and approximate independence)

So, to increase this certainty, population encoding can be adopted. Even if a single neuron’s 10 ms window yields limited spike counts, averaging across many neurons can reduce estimation variance, making a short-window rate estimate more compatible with a steady-state rate surrogate.
